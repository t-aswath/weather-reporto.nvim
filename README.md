# Install

### Packer
```lua
use ('bitspaceorg/weather-reporto.nvim')
```

### Vim-plug
```lua
Plug 'bitspaceorg/weather-reporto.nvim'
```

# How to use

After adding our plugin to your Neovim Config

This plugins works only when `setup` file  is called
```lua
-- provide the latitude and longitude of the location as string values 
require("weather").setup({
	latitude = "12.12345",   
	longitude = "34.12345",  
	celsius = true,          -- default farenheit
})
```

Here is a example were we are about to use our plugin in Dashboard and Status line

so, we have to call our plugin config file before dashboard and statusline config

**Dashboard**

Now lets display weather in our dashboard

```lua 
local var = require("weather") -- add this at the top of the file
```
Now 

`var.strfeed` is gonna give as temperature 

`var.cond`    is gonna give as weather condition 

you can use this variable were ever you want in your dashboard config.

**Status line**

Similarly you can do in your status line config 

Specify in which section of your status line you want to have weather

> lualine.nvim

here is example were I use our plugin in status line (lualine)

we need to write a small funtion as in above image in lualine config to work .

```lua
local var = require("weather")

local line = function()
	return var.strfeed
end
```

> feline

In feline there is no need to create such function as in lualine by just calling our plugin in your feline config and specify in which part you want to disply.
```lua
--example
local c = {
    weather_reporto = {
        provider = var.cond, 
        icon = {
            str = var.strfeed,
        },
        hl = {
            fg = "#8f96a0",
            bg = "#0c0e18",
            style = "bold"
        },
    }
}
local left = {}

local middle = {
    c.weather_reporto,
}

local right = {}

local components = {
    active = {
        left,
        middle,
        right,
    },
    inactive = {
        middle
    },
}

feline.setup({
    components = components,
})
```
